# My Personal Project -- A Game

## Answering questions

What will this application do:
- It is a simple game made up of 6 mazes for the user to complete and get to the end room.
- Based on completion of stretch goals this may change.

Who will use it:
- For any casual gamer or just as a simple game to de-stress after work.

Why is this project of interest to me:
- I like playing games and this would be an interesting jump into making games for hopefully and fun journey.

## Basic Functionality:

Primary goals:
- There will be total of 6 mazes in increasing difficulty for the user to complete.
- The screen will also have medals shown, greyed out if not yet obtained and colorful if obtained.
- They will be shown on the main screen numbered 1 to 6 with the number corresponding to the difficulty (1 being the
easiest).
- After completing each maze, the user will collect a medal at the end (easily see able), it will be a collectible and
will add to their data.
- The medals will be numbered randomly so that this can be linked to *Extra stretch goals*.
- Then they will come back to the start by a teleport circle.
- Once all maps are complete, the game will check based on the number of medals, another
gate will appear to lead to the end credits/room.

Stretch Goals:
- To cover the map in black with only the start and the end being see-able as the user progresses, they will be able to
- see more of the map (it unlocks a fixed number of blocks around them each time) with it being permanently see-able.
- This data about how much of the map can be seen should be sent to the data file so that it can be called upon resuming. 
- I will have to add a function on the start screen (this will not be there unless this code has been implemented),
where the user will be able to switch this difficulty off.

Extra Stretch Goals:
- I will make 3 different mini puzzles like those adds you see on YouTube about flowing water etc. to get to some
treasure. These will be assigned to specific numbers so that they are random and can be seen is any maze based on luck.
- This will mean that the medal is given after the puzzle is complete.
- A different extra stretch goal is also making variations of mazes for each level to keep it fresh.

## User Stories:

Story 1

As a user I want to be able to start a game. <br>
I should be able to pick a specific level to play out of the 6.<br>
I should be able to add a medal to my collection.<br>
I should be able to teleport out of a maze with the medal.<br>
I should be able to quit and come back to the state I left the game in.<br>
I should be able to add all medals by commands, and then hence get to end credits.<br>

<br>
*I will  add more based on program completion and completion of stretch goals.*
